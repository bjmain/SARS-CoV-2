#### This is my hackish attempt to fight fear with information. Not add fear.
#### Definitions:
COVID-19 refers to the disease (coronavirus disease 2019). 

A more informative name would be: severe acute respiratory syndrome = SARS2 (2 because a related virus (SARS) emerged in 2002 from a completemly different region of China via horseshoe bat --> civets --> meat market --> human.

SARS2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out at in Wuhan China, likely via bat --> pangolin --> meat market --> human.


##### I added death rate trends from Spain so we can watch how different counties "flatten" the curve by measures like shelter-in-place.
#### These trends have NOT been officially peer reviewed and there are probably errors and oversights.
That said, I am getting the data from a reputable source (Johns Hopkins Corona virus Resource Center) and the code is in this repo for your review. 

#### From the figure you can see that all US counties are well below last years flu death rate. So, what's the big deal?
##### - I added a projection of what happened in Spain (and continues to happen) and you can see that within a few weeks, we could be well above typical flu death rates. ** Based on Long Island (Suffolk county), which is among the hardest hit areas in the US, it is already clear that we are going to be better off than Spain. In CA, where shelter-in-place measures were imposed early, we MAY even be able to stay close to typical flu numbers. By next week (~April 7), we should be able to make better predictions about how this is progressing in each region.

#### Why am I only plotting deaths and not cases?
##### - I am guessing that the death numbers are less impacted by regional differences in testing rates and deaths kinda don't go unreported. 

#### Why did I use Spain for a reference?
##### - I think Spain is the worst case scenario. I could have used italy, but the global death numbers are only by country, and Northern and Southern Italy's death rates are very different.
